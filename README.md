# JobSiteWebscrapingSalaryPrediction

A fun project to webscrape Indeed.co.uk and use the data to predict salary ranges for job postings without salaries.

The code is held in the Jupyter Notebook, along with commentary about my approach and thought process when completing the project. The code can be run from the Jupyter Notebook without any changes or adaptions.
